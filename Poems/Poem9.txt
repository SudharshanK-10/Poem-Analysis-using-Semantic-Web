I held a full moon
At noon,
I tried to get it out

But my fingers were glued to it
And they settled in its pit,
Where no light has ever spooned.

I stretched
And had a great fall
Surprisingly, I floated tall

And felt an immaculate phonon
Vibrating within my spinal cord,
In turns it made a complete span

Underneath the trees;
And over the Ivory towersâ€¦
The moon scents like flowers

Its light glowed in righteousness
I touched deeper, it pulled a trigger
And smacked me down to the edge.

Each touch slammed me a voltage
Louder than all thunderstruck..
Then it sparked me into breath.

Life rushed and flowed into my brain,
Connecting nerves with rays of love
Gravity could feel the urge

The moon I held was true;
Let it rain or scotch in mist and dew
Every now and forevermore

I'll bring this moon to you
For at the touch of love,
Everyone becomes a poet.
